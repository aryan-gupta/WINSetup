# Scripts
Various scripts I have written over the years. This repo started out as 
a setup scripts repository, that would setup my windows machine the way
I wanted to, however since I have moved to full time linux user on my
laptop, I decided to rename it and make the repo more generic. This
repo now holds scripts that have no place in any of my other repos


## Folder Structure
